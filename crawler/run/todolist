1. files containing parameters: DiskQueue.h, CrawlerApp.cpp, CrawlerManager.h
2. remember changing the disk queue size to 1024 or above in DiskQueue.h before formal crawling
3. uncomment crawler.cpp
4. comment Print statements in file CrawlerManager.cpp

For testing crawler manager:
0. make sure the frontier and the index_files are empty, and remove the file "bloomfilter" if any
1. put your ip address in line 23 in file CrawlerManager.h
2. change the EXEC variable on line 47 to managerTestM2 and make
3. run ./managerTestM2 > M2.out
4. it may happen to exit before any standard outputs, run multiple times until you see there are both "Send: My own url = " and "Send: other's url = ".( don't need to clear frontier or index_files or bloomfilter when you are giving different attempts )

Q:
Why sometimes threads exit before any cralwer prints?
